							<h1>How To Invite Our Discord Bot</h1>
							<p>
								To invite our discord bot this step is just like other discord bot step, but if you don't know we have these step for you to follow
								<h3>Step 1 to 2: Clicking the button, giving the bot permission</h3>
								To invite our discord bot from our website we put a button for you to click and it will take you to the page to invite the bot,
								that page is from discord it is the permission page this page is the page for the bot and this page is how you give the required permissions
								for the bot, so our bot need the #Administrator Permission to function correctly if you dont give the bot this permission the bot feature
								will not work so it is important for the bot to have this permission, to give the bot this permission you need to click on the check box in front of the
								#Administrator Permission to give the bot that permission.
								<h3>Step 3: Authorize As A Humans</h3>
								We know this sound pretty weird for the people who dont know, but the last step that discord need you to do is doing the puzzle for discord to confirm that
								you are a humans, by completing the puzzle, to complete the puzzle you need to click on the check box on the white box and complete the puzzle, the puzzle isn'<table>
									the same for other people so don't get confused by this part, and it also not the same when you invite another bot into your discord server, so keep in mind
									that the puzzle you completed every time it not gonna be the same at the next time, it might be the same if you completed correct with that same puzzle it will keep
									showing that puzzle for you to complete every time you want to invite another bot into your discord server.
									<h3>Hint: The Invite Button is above this sentence</h3><br><br>
									<h3>New Update: [New][Bot Update] Website and bot Update</h3>
									<p>This update include new website page that isn't completed yet, and it
	 								 include new invite link for the bot new update please kick the bot from your server and use
	 								 the new invite link to invite them again because the bot now need a create command permission and the new invite
	 								 has that permission but ikf you already invited your bot with the old link then the
	 								 bot new update will not work for you, so you need to invite the bot again for this to work</p>
